/*
 * This is the base CSS of the new beta look.
 *
 * The beta-layout tree gives us all the core css broken out into five files
 * (as per https://smacss.com/book/type-layout):
 *     1.  _base.css.scss    - defaults, including the variables, mixins, and resets from Bootstrap
 *     2.  _layout.css.scss  - dividing the pages into sections, including the grid and scaffolding from Bootstrap
 *     3.  _modules.css.scss - modular / reusable parts of the design
 *     4.  _state.css.scss   - modules in a particular state
 *     5.  _theme.css.scss   - do I need this?
 *
 * The utility classes need to be loaded last, so those are included here.
 *
 *= require jquery-ui/autocomplete
 *= require_self
